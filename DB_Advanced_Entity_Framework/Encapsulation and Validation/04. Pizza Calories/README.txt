4. Pizza Calories
A Pizza is made of dough and different toppings. You should model a class Pizza, which should have a name, dough and toppings as fields. Every type of ingredient should have its own class. Every ingredient has different properties: the dough can be white or wholegrain and in addition, it can be crispy, chewy or homemade. The toppings can be of type meat, veggies, cheese or sauce. Every ingredient should have a weight in grams and a method for calculating its calories according to its type. Calories per gram are calculated through modifiers. Every ingredient has 2 calories per gram as a base and a modifier that gives the exact calories. For example, a white dough has a modifier of 1.5, a chewy dough has a modifier of 1.1, which means that a white chewy dough weighting 100 grams will have 100 * 1.5 * 1.1 = 330.00 total calories.
Your job is to model the classes in such a way that they are properly encapsulated and to provide a public method for every pizza that calculates its calories according to the ingredients it has. 

Step 1. Create a Dough Class
The base ingredient of a Pizza is the dough. First, you need to create a class for it. It has a flour type, which can be white or wholegrain. In addition, it has a baking technique, which can be crispy, chewy or homemade. A dough should have a weight in grams. The calories per gram of a dough are calculated depending on the flour type and the baking technique. Every dough has 2 calories per gram as a base and a modifier that gives the exact calories. For example, a white dough has a modifier of 1.5, a chewy dough has a modifier of 1.1, which means that a white chewy dough weighting 100 grams will have (2 * 100) * 1.5 * 1.1 = 330.00 total calories. You are given the modifiers below:
Modifiers:
•	White – 1.5;
•	Wholegrain – 1.0;
•	Crispy – 0.9;
•	Chewy – 1.1;
•	Homemade – 1.0;
Everything that the class should expose is a getter for the calories per gram. Your task is to create the class with a proper constructor, fields, getters and setters. Make sure you use the proper access modifiers.

Step 2. Validate Data for the Dough Class
Change the internal logic of the Dough class by adding a data validation in the setters.
Make sure that if invalid flour type or an invalid baking technique is given a proper exception is thrown with the message "Invalid type of dough.".
The allowed weight of a dough is in the range [1..200] grams. If it is outside of this range throw an exception with the message "Dough weight should be in the range [1..200].".
Exception Messages
•	"Invalid type of dough."
•	"Dough weight should be in the range [1..200]."

Step 3. Create a Topping Class
Next, you need to create a Topping class. It can be of four different types – meat, veggies, cheese or a sauce. A topping has a weight in grams. The calories per gram of topping are calculated depending on its type. The base calories per gram are 2. Every different type of topping has a modifier. For example, meat has a modifier of 1.2, so a meat topping will have 1.2 calories per gram (1 * 1.2). Everything that the class should expose is a getter for calories per gram. You are given the modifiers below:
Modifiers:
•	Meat – 1.2;
•	Veggies – 0.8;
•	Cheese – 1.1;
•	Sauce – 0.9;
Your task is to create the class with a proper constructor, fields, getters and setters. Make sure you use the proper access modifiers.

Step 4. Validate Data for the Topping Class
Change the internal logic of the Topping class by adding a data validation in the setter.
Make sure the topping is one of the provided types, otherwise throw a proper exception with the message "Cannot place [name of invalid argument] on top of your pizza.".
The allowed weight of a topping is in the range [1..50] grams. If it is outside of this range throw an exception with the message "[Topping type name] weight should be in the range [1..50].".
Exception Messages
•	"Cannot place [name of invalid argument] on top of your pizza."
•	"[Topping type name] weight should be in the range [1..50]."

Step 5. Create a Pizza Class!
A Pizza should have a name, some toppings and a dough. Make use of the two classes you made earlier. In addition, a pizza should have public getters for its name, number of toppings and the total calories. The total calories are calculated by summing the calories of all the ingredients a pizza has. Create the class using a proper constructor, expose a method for adding a topping, a public setter for the dough and a getter method for the total calories.
The input for a pizza consists of several lines. On the first line is the pizza name and the number of toppings it has. On the second line, you will get input for the dough. On the next lines, you will receive every topping the pizza has. The number of lines for the toppings will correspond to the number of toppings declared on the first line.
If creation of the pizza was successful, print on a single line the name of the pizza and the total calories it has.

Step 6. Validate Data for the Pizza Class
The name of the pizza should not be an empty string. In addition, it should not be longer than 15 symbols. If it does not fit, throw an exception with the message "Pizza name should be between 1 and 15 symbols.".
The number of toppings should be in range [0..10]. If not, throw an exception with the message "Number of toppings should be in range [0..10]."
Your task is to print the name of the pizza and the total calories it has according to the examples below.

Examples
Input:
Pizza Meatless
Dough Wholegrain Crispy 100
Topping Veggies 50
Topping Cheese 50
END

Output:
Meatless - 370.00 Calories.

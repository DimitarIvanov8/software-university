Student System
Your task is to create a database for the Student System, using the EF Core Code First approach. It should look like this:
 
Constraints
Your namespaces should be:
•	P01_StudentSystem – for your Startup class, if you have one
•	P01_StudentSystem.Data – for your DbContext
•	P01_StudentSystem.Data.Models – for your models

Your models should be:
•	StudentSystemContext – your DbContext
•	Student:
o	StudentId
o	Name (up to 100 characters, unicode)
o	PhoneNumber (exactly 10 characters, not unicode, not required)
o	RegisteredOn
o	Birthday (not required)

•	Course:
o	CourseId
o	Name (up to 80 characters, unicode)
o	Description (unicode, not required)
o	StartDate
o	EndDate
o	Price

•	Resource:
o	ResourceId
o	Name (up to 50 characters, unicode)
o	Url (not unicode)
o	ResourceType (enum – can be Video, Presentation, Document or Other)
o	CourseId

•	Homework:
o	HomeworkId
o	Content (string, linking to a file, not unicode)
o	ContentType (enum – can be Application, Pdf or Zip)
o	SubmissionTime
o	StudentId
o	CourseId

•	StudentCourse – mapping class between Students and Courses

Table relations:	
•	One student can have many CourseEnrollments
•	One student can have many HomeworkSubmissions
•	One course can have many StudentsEnrolled
•	One course can have many Resources
•	One course can have many HomeworkSubmissions
You will need a constructor, accepting DbContextOptions to test your solution in Judge!

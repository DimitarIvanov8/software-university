Initial Setup 

Write a program that connects to your localhost server. Create new database called MinionsDB where we will keep information about our minions and villains. 
For each minion we should keep information about its name, age and town.  Each town has information about the country where it’s located. Villains have name and evilness factor (super good, good, bad, evil, super evil). Each minion can serve several villains and each villain can have several minions serving him. Fill all tables with at least 5 records each.
In the end you shoud have the following tables: 
•	Countries
•	Towns
•	Minions
•	EvilnessFactors
•	Villains
•	MinionsVillains
